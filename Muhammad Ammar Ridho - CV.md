### EXPERIENCE

Build Portofolio Website With React and Tailwind 06/2025 - Present
Portofolio - Ammar Ridho

Developed a dynamic single-page portfolio website using JavaScript and the React framework. Leveraged Tailwind CSS for a
modern, responsive, and creative user interface design. The site showcases projects, skills, and experiences in an engaging
and interactive format.

Person In Charge Data Mining Competition 05/2025 - Present
PRODIGI

Led the Data Mining Division with a focus on nurturing and developing talents to excel in competitive fields such as Data
Mining, AI Innovation, and Data Analytics. Designed and executed programs to strengthen members’ technical and
competitive skills through mentoring, project-based learning, and internal training. Established and managed a Data Mining &
Data Science community as a communication hub to share opportunities and knowledge, including competitions, online
courses, workshops, and seminars, fostering collaboration and continuous learning among members.

Web Scraping - Research and Development 04/2025 - Present
Central Computer Improvement

Developed and maintained web scraping and crawling solutions for social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook) using
TypeScript with tools such as Puppeteer, Axios, and Fetch API. Implemented account session handling to retrieve stable API
responses, enabling reliable and efficient data collection. Successfully optimized crawling pipelines to achieve robust and
scalable performance, supporting the organization’s research and analytics needs.

1st Placed Leaderboard Kaggle Data Slayer 2025 11/2025 - 12/
Telkom University Purwokerto

I developed a landmark-based video analysis pipeline using MediaPipe and YOLOv8 for robust face, hand, and pose feature
extraction, engineered geometric ratios (MAR, EAR, Hand Aspect Ratio), applied temporal frame aggregation, and trained an
ensemble model (XGBoost, Random Forest, CatBoost) to achieve 1st place on the Kaggle Data Slayer 2025 leaderboard.

Finalist GEMASTIK XVIII Data Mining 09/2025 - 09/
Kemendikbudristek

Developed a fraud detection system for P2P lending platforms using a hybrid approach of Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN) and optimized ensemble learning (XGBoost, CatBoost, HistGradientBoosting). The model achieved an AUC score of
0.8330, outperforming several state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., GraphSAGE, TGN). This accomplishment demonstrates the
ability to design scalable machine learning solutions for imbalanced, large-scale financial datasets, while contributing to
Indonesia’s financial technology independence.

10th Placed Leaderboard Kaggle Datavidia Competition 03/2025 - 04/
HMIF - Institut Teknologi Bandung

Built a deep learning model to forecast daily food prices for 13 commodities across 34 Indonesian provinces. Integrated
exogenous features. Evaluated multiple neural architectures (NHITS, NBEATSx, LSTM, TiDE, TSMixerx), with NHITS achieving
best performance

3th Placed ADIKARA Data Mining Competition 11/2024 - 01/
PRODIGI and FIF Telkom University

Developed a hybrid deep learning architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast multivariate food price indices across countries.
